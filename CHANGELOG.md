## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-27

First versioned release. Establishes the baseline for all future upgrades.

### Added
- 45 skills across Product, Engineering, QA, Growth, Ops & Risk, and system management
- 9 agents: 6 top-level (Orchestrator, Product, Engineering, QA & Release, Growth, Ops & Risk) + 3 engineering sub-agents (Backend, Frontend, DevOps)
- 23 tool scripts for artifact validation, CI, QA, security, deployment, and registry
- Smart merge installer (`install.sh`) with `--force` flag for safe upgrades
- Engineering Agent restructured as Staff Engineer orchestrator with Task tool delegation to sub-agents
- Context7 library documentation lookup mandated before implementation
- Git commit standards integrated into CLAUDE.md and engineering agent
- Optimized agent model assignments for cost efficiency (opus for orchestrator/engineering, sonnet for sub-agents, haiku for lightweight tasks)
- Artifact enforcement chain: validate.sh → link.sh → promote.sh → check-gate.sh
- Stage-aware gating: `idea` stage makes gates advisory, `mvp` enforces core gates, `growth`/`scale` enforces all
- Setup wizard with interactive, express, and auto-extract modes
- Versioned upgrade system with dry-run, check, backup, manifest-based conflict detection, and `/upgrade-company-os` skill

### Migration
This is the baseline release. No migration needed.
